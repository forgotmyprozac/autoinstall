# SOFTWARE TO INSTALL
# NOTES:
# the "cinst" command installs a Chocolatey package for you. I ended up using "cinstm" - that only does the install if the package isn't installed before.

# browsers
cinst googlechrome -force

# text editors
cinst atom -force

# everything else
cinst teamviewer -force
